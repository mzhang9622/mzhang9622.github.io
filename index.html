                        The player plays as a chicken (with sprite borrowed from ConcernApe), to attack the slimes and level up.
                        If the player's attack is less than the slime's hp, they will lose and launch a lose screen. To win, they must keep fighting the slimes until they reach max level.

                        This number is adjustable, which allows the analysis of the win rates with different given hitnumbers.

                        For solvable solutions, it will eventually solve the puzzle. However, it will run endlessly if a puzzle without a solution is given.

                        The research was about the classic graph-based game: Cops and Robbers. The students were responsible for developing an algorithm that determined whether a graph is cop-win or cop-lose.
                        Throughout the research, many definitions, theorems, and lemmas were defined. The results are unofficially written.
